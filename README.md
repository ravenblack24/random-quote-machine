## Status
Project is complete and an [interactive demo is available here](https://ravenblack24.github.io/random-quote-machine/).

## General info
This app was built to satisfy and subsequently validated against the following User Stories:

- **User Story #1**: I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".

- **User Story #2**: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".

- **User Story #3**: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".

- **User Story #4**: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".

- **User Story #5**: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".

- **User Story #6**: On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".

- **User Story #7**: On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".

- **User Story #8**: When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.

- **User Story #9**: My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.

- **User Story #10**: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quotea element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote.

- **User Story #11**: The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
